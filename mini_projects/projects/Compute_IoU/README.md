## Description

The project will help you calculate Intersection over Union (IoU).

## About this Project

Intersection over Union (IoU) is used when calculating mAP. It is a number from 0 to 1 that specifies the amount of overlap between the predicted and ground truth bounding box.

## Usage

Use the Script [Compute_IoU.py](https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects/blob/master/projects/Compute_IoU/Compute_IoU.py) . In the command line, Enter

`python3 Compute_IoU.py `
